MAIN DESCRIPTION

This Python script is a text-based Pokemon battle simulator. It allows the user to create a Pokemon trainer, choose their trainer's name, select a starter Pokemon from a predefined list (Bulbasaur, Charmander, or Squirtle), and engage in battles against a wild Charmander.

Here's a summary of how the script works:

1. The script imports classes from the "pokemon.trainer" and "pokemon.character" modules.
2. The `main()` function is defined as the starting point of the program.
3. The user is prompted to input the name of their Pokemon trainer, and the name is stored in the `trainer` object.
4. The user is presented with a list of starter Pokemon (Bulbasaur, Charmander, Squirtle) and asked to choose one. The chosen Pokemon is added to the trainer's Pokemon list.
5. The user enters a battle loop where their trainer's Pokemon battles a wild Charmander until one of the Pokemon is defeated.
6. In each battle iteration, the user chooses their Pokemon attacker from their trainer's Pokemon list and selects a move from the available moves for that Pokemon.
7. The chosen move is used against the wild Charmander, and the battle outcome is determined. The loop continues until the player decides to quit the game or the Pokemon are unable to continue battling.
